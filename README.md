# DroidClaw

A lightweight AI agent for Android, built to run in Termux.

---

## What it does

DroidClaw connects an LLM to your Android device. You chat with it, it figures out what you need and does it — calls, SMS, files, torch, location, running scripts, whatever.

It's not magic. It's just a tight loop: you talk, it thinks, it acts, it tells you what happened.

---

## Features

- **Phone control** — calls, SMS, torch, vibrate, location, clipboard, notifications
- **File access** — read/write to your storage
- **Memory** — remembers things across sessions
- **Living docs** — maintains notes about you, your device, and ongoing tasks
- **Run anything** — executes any shell command via the `exec` tool
- **Bring your own API** — works with NVIDIA NIM (free), or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

---

## Requirements

- Android phone with [Termux](https://termux.dev)
- [Termux:API](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:API) app installed
- Node.js 18+
- A free API key from [NVIDIA NIM](https://build.nvidia.com)

---

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/droidclaw
cd droidclaw
npm install
node src/index.js
```

First run will walk you through setup — name, API key, model. Takes under a minute.

## Usage

Just talk to it naturally:

```
> check my battery
84% — unplugged, running fine

> torch on
done

> send sms to 9123456789 say running late
sent

> whats in my downloads
[lists your files]

> write a python script that prints fibonacci and save it to downloads
